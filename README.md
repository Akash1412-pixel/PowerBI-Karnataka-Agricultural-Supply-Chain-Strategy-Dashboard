### Introduction:
The agricultural sector in Karnataka is a vital part of the state's economy, and efficient management of the supply chain is crucial for maximizing productivity and minimizing costs. This Power BI dashboard offers a strategic view of the agricultural supply chain, focusing on transportation efficiency, fuel costs, land utilization, and associated costs. The following sections will guide you through the insights derived from this dashboard.

- **Average Capacity for Both (Transport & Storage):** 7.25 tonnes
- **Fuel per KM:** â‚¹15
- **Mileage for Buying:** 6.50 KM/L

These metrics provide an overview of the transportation efficiency within the agricultural supply chain. The average capacity indicates the amount of agricultural produce that can be transported or stored per trip. Fuel costs and mileage offer insights into the operational costs associated with transportation, which are crucial for optimizing logistics and reducing expenses.

- **Net Area Sown Hectares vs. Cultivable Waste Hectares:** This chart compares the amount of land sown for crops with the land classified as cultivable waste. This comparison is crucial for identifying districts where agricultural land is underutilized, allowing for targeted efforts to bring more land under cultivation.
  
- **Net Area Sown Hectares vs. Cropping Intensity Hectares:** This chart shows the relationship between the net area sown and the intensity of cropping in various districts. Cropping intensity reflects how frequently the land is used for crop production, indicating the efficiency of land use.

These visualizations help stakeholders understand the current state of land use in Karnataka's agriculture, identifying opportunities for improving land utilization and productivity.

### Step 3: Cost Management in the Agricultural Supply Chain

**Bar Charts:**

- **Sum of Cost by Options:** This chart compares the costs associated with different options, such as renting versus buying resources (like transport vehicles or storage facilities). Understanding these costs can help in making strategic decisions about resource management, potentially leading to significant cost savings.

- **Cost Per Unit by Type and Nature:** This visualization breaks down costs based on the type (e.g., jute bags versus cardboard crates) and nature (eco-friendly vs. non-eco-friendly) of packaging materials. Choosing the right packaging material can have a substantial impact on both costs and environmental sustainability.

These charts are vital for managing the financial aspects of the agricultural supply chain, ensuring that operations remain cost-effective while also considering sustainability.
